#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - COURSERA

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The following files are available in this repository:

* `CodeBook.md`: describes the data set and the data transformations
* `run_analysis.R`: a R script that performs all the steps of the data transformation (file download, unzip, merge, subsetting and column renaming) 
* `tidy_data_set.txt`: the final product with the average of the data set, after all the transformation steps.


##Data Overview

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

The data is avaliable at:
